# Assignment 12: Mission to Mars - Soo Bin
For this assignment, various pieces of information about Mars are scraped and put into an application. The following libraries were used to complete this assignment:

* BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape data and images;
* Pandas was used to convert a DataFrame into an HTML format;
* Flask was used to design the application; and
* PyMongo was used to store the data scraped into a database.

For codes, please refer to the following documents:

* `mission_to_mars.ipynb` for scraping using Jupyter Notebook
* `app.py` for the application
* `scrape_mars.py` for scraping for the application
* `templates/index.html` for designing the web application

This is how the app is shown on Chrome (`screenshot_SooBin.png`):
